White Lenslet Image Guided Demosaicing for Plenoptic Cameras

This is a method developed to demosaic raw images taken with plenoptic cameras (eg Lytro 1 or Lytro Illum).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In order to use the demosaicing function, you also need to download the D. Dansereau's Light Field Toolbox:
https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49683-light-field-toolbox-v0-4

### Installing

In the toolbox folder, add our files and replace the file LFDecodeLensletImageSimple.m by our version.

Launch Matlab and follow the instructions given by D. Dansereau to use its toolbox.

By default the toolbox is now using our method of demosaicing to extract subaperture images.

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to Donald Dansereau for writing the Light Field Toolbox code
